# New homepage design (2019-02-19)
the new design was heavily influenced by other awesome academics (and their homepages), for example, [Yeaseul Kim](http://students.washington.edu/yeaseul1/): I pretty much stole her CSS, I hope she forgives me. 

I have removed the jekyll version and migrated to a pure HTML + Javascript homepage. 

I wanted to move away to be able to think more freely about content management options. 

# To-do
look into better content management
- mostly papers
- project websites

How to deal with misc content like blogs, detailed bio, research statements, etc.
