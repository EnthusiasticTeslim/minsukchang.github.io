# New homepage design
I have removed the jekyll version and migrated to a pure HTML + Javascript homepage. 
I wanted to move away to be able to think more freely about content management options. 

# To-do

was heavily influenced by other awesome academics (and their homepages), like [Yeaseul Kim](http://students.washington.edu/yeaseul1/)
