                <p>
                    From blogs to how-to videos to social media posts, it has become increasingly easy to share
                    knowledge online. In fact, even for a single task seemingly as simple as baking chocolate chip
                    cookies, we have access to hundreds of thousands to millions of tutorials in less than a second
                    through a simple web search. Each tutorial shared online is not only a set of task instructions, but
                    also a
                    display of unique set of skills, constraints, and strategies of the author.
                </p>
                <p>This diversity and scale of available online tutorials present users with both opportunities and
                    challenges. Specifically, it remains difficult 1) to compare and analyze which tutorial to follow
                    and invest the time to learn, and 2) to apply the picked tutorial to the current user’s expertise,
                    available tools, and other workflow context.
                </p>
                <p>This is because the currently used software interfaces treat tutorials and demonstrations as
                    one-dimensional sequence of events or instructions. Users need to go back and forth between the
                    search result and individual tutorials to compare and analyze how they’re different or similar from
                    one another. Also users have a difficult time conceptualizing how different methods agree and
                    disagree with each other, and understand what makes one tutorial work and the other not work.
                </p>
                <p>My research in human-computer interaction applies machine learning and human computation to study the
                    compositionality of naturally crowdsourced tutorials and demonstrations. I developed techniques for
                    extracting the nonlinear compositions of semantic substrates such as task-specific domain knowledge,
                    constraints, and users’ strategies in large scale tutorials and demonstrations. Then I demonstrated
                    how abstract representations reconstructed with these semantic substrates facilitate novel interface
                    designs that strengthen people’s ability to learn from tutorials.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My future work continues to study the compositionality and semantic representations of sequential
                    user generated data with the objective of building the next AI systems that can reason, plan, and imagine. 
                    I am especially interested in working with natural language, another user generated sequential data with rich semantic substrates.
                </p>

                <p>I also spend my time thinking about ways we can improve learning at scale (i.e. MOOC) by computationally modeling the
                    underlying peer dynamics to leverage them in learning interfaces.</p>
